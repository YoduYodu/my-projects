# About this guide #
- In L20 (if it had not been cancelled), I would have demonstrated how to do this in class.
- Instead, you will need to follow the step-by-step instructions (see the Goolge Docs link above).
- If you do not complete these, your future labs & projects (namely, Projects 04-06 and Labs 09-12) may not be graded.
- There's no deadline for this setup, but again, if you don't do this in timely manner and you later realized that your labs and projects are not being graded because of this, then it is your responsibility (the teaching staff will not be able to help you if you ask for help the same day the assignments are due). 
- It will only take 15-20 minutes of your time to set everything up. 
- **I strongly suggest that you finish this by March 20 (Friday).**
- **If you do not complete this by then, I will assume that you are willingly risking 35% or more of your course grade (Projects 04-06 are worth 35% of your course grade).**
- If you run into trouble, post on Piazza your errors/screenshots & which steps you are stuck in **publicly (but maybe anonymously if you want to)**.
- If you have not followed the instructions in Lab 06 (Java Task), then you will have to do that; otherwise, you will not be able to complete Task D below.


# Task A #
Follow the Google Docs.

# Task B #
Follow the Google Docs.

# Task C #
Follow the Google Docs (and come back here and read about `Task D` when you are ready to run your first Dataflow job).

# Task D #

- Check out the code from this repo (specifically, you need `L20/java`).
- Execute the main method from Eclipse or intelliJ. Or you can do it from command-line (do `$ gradle run` under `L20/java/dataflow` directory).
- If you get an error message like the one in https://github.com/cs-rocks/cs686-lectures/blob/master/L20/java/dataflow/resources/logs01.txt, then you either didn't follow the instructions from earlier steps or you didn't set up your GCP Credentials properly (see Lab 06 "Java Task" again). If either of these two applies, then you should re-read the instructions and follow them. 
- If your job runs successfully, then you will be able to see it from the Dataflow Web Console page (after a while, because your machine will need to upload many files to your GCS bucket.
