This file was used in Lecture 14 for demonstrating BQ features.

You should load this file to BigQuery, and practice running queries on BigQuery (see L14 slides for sample "questions").

About performances - as mentioned in class, we won't worry too much about the performances yet, but you should still try your best to follow the best practices and avoid anti-patterns. We will later analyze query performances and cost analyses.
